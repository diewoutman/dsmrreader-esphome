# dsmrreader-esphome

Esphome configuration for use with the [Slimme Lezer Uitlezer v4.5](https://opencircuit.nl/product/slimme-meter-uitlezer-v4.5-geassembleerd)

Originally the board will be flashed with [DSMRloggerApi firmware]([Documentatie DSMRloggerAPI firmware - DSMRloggerAPI](https://mrwheel-docs.gitbook.io/dsmrloggerapi/))

For me integration with home assistant is important and found it to be a little bit lacking. So ultimatly i decided to flash Esphome firmware.

Pretty much everything seems to work like it did Hardware wise. (powering from the p1 port)
